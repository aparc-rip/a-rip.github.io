	<p><a name="motivation"></a><h3>Motivation and Goals</h3>
	The middle atmosphere and climate community use reanalyses widely to understand atmospheric 
	processes and variability in the middle atmosphere, to validate climate models (e.g. CCMVal, CCMI), 
	and, potentially, for trend analysis. Yet different reanalyses give different results for the same 
	diagnostic - for example the global energy budget and hydrological cycle, the Brewer-Dobson 
	circulation, stratospheric vortex weakening and intensification events, and large-scale wave activity at 
	the tropical tropopause. There is thus a need for a coordinated reanalysis intercomparison project 
	that shall start a comprehensive activity to compare all appropriate reanalysis data sets for “key” 
	diagnostics to help understand the causes of differences and to use the results to provide guidance 
	on appropriate usage of various reanalysis products in scientific studies. In addition, the reanalysis 
	community will benefit from coordinated user feedback, which can lead to improvements in the next 
	generation of reanalysis products.</p>
 
	<p>The SPARC Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) is one of the SPARC activities that had been proposed in 2012 
and was endorsed by the SPARC Scientific Steering Group as an emerging SPARC activity in February 2012 and as a full SPARC activity in January 2014 
(Fujiwara et al., 2012; Fujiwara and Jackson, 2013). 

The goals of S-RIP are to: 
	<ol>
	  <li>Create a communication platform between the SPARC
	  community and the reanalysis centres
	  <li> Understand current reanalysis products and to contribute to future reanalysis improvements 
	  in the middle atmosphere region 
	  <li>Write up the results of the reanalysis intercomparison in peer reviewed papers and a SPARC 
	  report.
	</ol></p>

	<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]<a name="scope"></a><h3>Scope</h3>
	By August 2012, a Working Group had been formed, and the reanalysis centre contacts for the 
	project had been confirmed. The Working Group discussed chapter titles, co-leads, and initial 
	contributors to the final SPARC report and organised an S-RIP Planning Meeting, which was held at 
	the Met Office, Exeter, UK, from 29 April-1 May 2013. The purposes of the meeting were to finalise 
	the report outline, to determine the diagnostics list and observational data for validation required for 
	each chapter, to agree on the general guidelines and protocols, and to define the project timetable.</p>
	
	At the meeting it was decided that the project would focus predominantly on reanalyses (although 
	some chapters may include diagnostics from operational analyses). Available and soon to be 
	available reanalyses are shown in Table 1. For most of the chapters, we will compare newer 
	reanalyses, i.e., MERRA, ERA-Interim, JRA-25/JCDAS, JRA-55, NCEP-CFSR, and 20CR. We also 
	aim to include ERA-20C, ERA-SAT, MERRA-2, etc., when available. Some chapters may include 
	older reanalyses such as R-1, R-2, and ERA-40, because they have been heavily used in the past 
	and are still being used for certain studies, and to gain insight into potential shortcomings of past 
	research results. For some chapters, only a subset of these reanalyses shall be used, since some 
	reanalyses have already been shown to be poor for some studies (eg ERA-40 for polar processes), or 
	do not extend to high enough levels (eg 20CR does not extend above the stratopause). At the 
	beginning of each chapter an explanation will be given as to why specific reanalyses were included or 
	excluded. The intercomparison period is 1979-2012, i.e., “the satellite era,” but some chapters will 
	also consider the pre-satellite era before 1979. Given the wide use of ERA-40 (which only runs to 
	2002) a separate intercomparison for 1979-2002 shall be carried out for some diagnostics and placed 
        in an Appendix.</p>

	<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]<a name="outline"></a><h3>Outline Plan for S-RIP Report</h3>
	Summarised below are the draft plans for the S-RIP final report. Issues related to transport processes 
	and gravity wave issues will be distributed amongst several chapters.</p>

	<p><b>Chapter 1: Introduction.</b> The S-RIP motivation, goals, rationale and report structure are described.</p> 
 
	<p><b>Chapter 2. Description of the reanalysis systems.</b> This chapter will include a detailed description 
	of the forecast model, assimilation scheme and observational data assimilated for each reanalysis, 
	together with information on each reanalysis “stream” and on what data are archived.</p>
 
	<p><b>Chapter 3. Climatology and interannual variability of dynamical variables.</b> A climatology of major 
	dynamical variables (eg zonal mean temperature, zonal mean wind), created from an ensemble of the 
	newer reanalyses for the period 1979&ndash;2012 (1979&ndash;2002, allowing comparison with ERA-40, in the 
	appendix) will be created on both standard pressure levels and potential temperature levels. Various 
	key plots of the ensemble climatological means and individual reanalysis anomalies from these 
	means will be created and presented in an online atlas. Inter-reanalysis variations will be quantified. 
	Independent observations (ie not used in the reanalyses) which can be used for validation include 
	radiosondes, lidars, rocketsondes and various satellites.</p>
 
	<p><b>Chapter 4. Climatology and interannual variability of ozone and water vapour.</b> This chapter will 
	include a detailed evaluation of ozone and water vapour in the reanalyses using a range of 
	observations obtained from sonde, aircraft, and satellite instruments. The diagnostics considered will 
	include climatological evaluations, seasonal cycles, interannual variability, and trends. Other, more 
	event-based diagnostics such as the tape recorder, QBO, and polar dehydration will be used to 
	understand differences in the climatological evaluations, while detailed analysis of these processes 
        will be covered in the “advanced” chapters. In addition, relevant information on the assimilated ozone 
        and water vapour, and the prognostic representation of these fields in the reanalyses will be 
        summarized.</p> 
 
        <p><b>Chapter 5. Brewer-Dobson circulation.</b> This chapter will evaluate stratospheric circulation using
        diagnostics such as the age-of-air (mean age and spectrum), metrics for the strength of mixing 
        barriers, and residual circulation quantities. Tendencies for heat and momentum as well as analysis 
        increments will be considered. Eulerian chemistry transport models and trajectory calculations will be 
        used. Results will be validated against satellite, ground-based, balloon, and aircraft observations of 
        SF<sub>6</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>, including the recent MIPAS datasets. Both climatological
        results and trends in the main diagnostics will be examined.</p>
 
        <p><b>Chapter 6. Stratosphere-troposphere coupling.</b> This chapter covers two-way coupling between the 
        troposphere and stratosphere, focusing in particular on extra-tropical coupling on daily to 
        intraseasonal time scales, and how this shorter-term variability is modulated on interannual time 
        scales (e.g., by ENSO). The chapter will synthesize and compare established approaches with more 
        recent metrics to characterize planetary wave coupling and blocking, coupling of the zonal mean flow 
        (e.g. the annular modes), and the mechanism(s) connecting the stratosphere and troposphere (e.g., 
        changes in tropopause height). There has been recent discussion on how to best characterize 
        Stratospheric Sudden Warmings (SSWs). The established and alternative definitions of SSWs and 
        the resulting impact on diagnostics of stratosphere-troposphere coupling will be explored.</p>
 
        <p><b>Chapter 7. Extra-tropical UTLS.</b> The diagnostics to be produced will include tropopause 
        characterisation by commonly used methods, multiple tropopause characteristics, the tropopause 
        inversion layer, UTLS jet characteristics, estimates of horizontal boundaries between the ExUTLS 
        and TTL, air parcel histories using trajectory calculations, and measures of Rossby wave breaking.
        These diagnostics will be related to analysis of stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). This 
        chapter will also have a section that reviews diagnostics commonly applied to both the ExUTLS and 
        TTL.</p>
 
        <p><b>Chapter 8. TTL.</b> The diagnostics will include the general TTL structure (cold point and lapse rate 
        tropopause, etc.), clouds and convection (cloud fraction profiles, OLR, etc.), diabatic heat budget, 
        transport (Lagrangian cold point, residence time based on vertical winds and heating rates, etc.), 
        wave activity, and long-term changes (e.g., tropical belt widening).</p>
 
        <p><b>Chapter 9. QBO and tropical variability.</b> Diagnostics for this chapter will include analysis of the 
        tropical QBO, its extra-tropical teleconnections (as well as other relevant teleconnections such as with 
        ENSO and the solar cycle), its zonal momentum budget, and spectral characteristics of tropical 
        waves including modal analysis and equatorial wave energetics. Observations for validation include 
        operational and campaign radiosondes, rocketsondes, and satellites such as HIRDLS and SABER. 
        Information regarding non-orographic gravity wave parameterization (if present) and analysis 
        increments may also be utilised.</p>
 
        <p><b>Chapter 10. Polar processes.</b> This chapter will cover the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, 
        chlorine activation, denitrification and dehydration, and (possibly) chemical ozone loss in the lower 
        stratospheric winter polar vortices. Focus will be on process-oriented and case studies. The chapter 
        will also include a review of previous works showing significant biases in lower stratospheric 
        temperature, winds, or vortex strength / structure / evolution which render some reanalyses (e.g., R-1, 
        R-2, and ERA-40) unsuitable for polar process studies.</p>
 
        <p><b>Chapter 11. USLM.</b> This chapter will look at diagnostics including the Semi-Annual Oscillation, 
        climatology of the winter polar vortex, SSWs (focusing on stratopause evolution and mesospheric 
        cooling), waves (eg tides, the two-day wave, and normal modes), inertial instability at the tropical 
        stratopause, and Hadley circulation in the stratopause region. Observations including SABER, MLS, 
        the NDACC database, and CMAM30 (a model nudged to reanalysis), will be used for validation 
        purposes and to extend our knowledge of the state of the middle atmosphere. NOGAPS–ALPHA may 
        also be considered for case studies.</p> 
 
        <p><b>Chapter 12. Synthesis Summary. </b> Key findings, common patterns in results, recommendations for 
        future research and reanalysis development are summarized.</p>

	<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]<a name="schedule"></a><h3>Schedule</h3>
        We shall finalize the “basic” chapters (i.e., Chapters 1&ndash;4) within 2 years after the S-RIP Planning 
        Meeting. The “advanced” chapters (5&ndash;12) will evolve slightly more slowly, with an interim report on 
        these chapters every year. The plan is as follows. Top Level deliverables are in bold.<p> 
 
        <p>May 2014:
          <ul class="report">

            <li><b>Publish the S-RIP 2016 Report (for Chapters 1&ndash;4)</b>
	    <li>Write progress report for SPARC SSG
	  </ul>
          October 2016: 
          <ul class="report">
	    <li>Complete first-order drafts for Chapters 5&ndash;11
	  </ul>
	  May 2018:

	    <li><b>Complete “Advanced” Chapters (Chapters 5-12) and whole report</b>
	    <li><b>Review S-RIP and decide on extension of activity</b>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>A further key part of S-RIP will be to write peer-reviewed papers. This will be done at any appropriate 
	time. Wherever possible, the aim will be to write these papers prior to completion of the report, rather 
	than the other way around. This avoids problems with citations of original research.</p>

	<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]<a name="management"></a><h3>Management</h3>
	S-RIP is co-led by Masatomo Fujiwara (Japan), Lesley Gray (UK), and Gloria Manney (USA). The co-leads are members 
	of a wider Working Group, who help steer the direction of the project and coordinate the specifics of 
	the work. Other Working Group members are Thomas Birner (USA), Simon Chabrillat 
	(Belgium), Sean Davis (USA), Michaela Hegglin (UK), Kirstin Krueger 
	(Germany), Craig Long (USA), and Susann Tegtmeier (Germany).</p>
	  
	<p>Each reanalysis centre also has a contact who is involved in S-RIP and whose presence is vital to 
	ensure the two-way flow of knowledge between researchers and the reanalysis centres. The 
	reanalysis centre contacts are Rossana Dragani (ECMWF), Craig Long (NCEP), Wesley Ebisuzaki (NCEP), 
	Kazutoshi Onogi (JMA), Yayoi Harada (JMA), Steven Pawson (NASA/GMAO), Gilbert Compo 
	(NOAA), Jeffrey Whitaker (University of Colorado).</p> 
	  
	<p>Each chapter of the report has nominated co-leads who organise the production of relevant 
	diagnostics and the chapter writing. The chapter co-leads are shown in Table 2. Thirty-five scientists 
	from 10 countries have expressed their wish to be Chapter Leads or Contributing Authors for S-RIP. 
	This number will grow as the project develops.</p>

	Predictability) and SPARC-DAWG (Data Assimilation Working Group) through the obvious links in 
	stratospheric analyses and impacts of analyses on stratospheric forecasting that these groups also 
	work on. Reanalyses are widely used to validate climate models and thus there are clear linkages 
	between the activities of S-RIP and of CCMI. There is also scope for interaction with the SPARC 
	activities on Temperature Trends and Trace Gas / Aerosol Climatologies. Leading members of these 
	three activities are also in the S-RIP Working Group, thus enhancing opportunities for co-ordination 
	and collaboration. S-RIP has been publicised at WGNE (WMO Working Group on Numerical 
	Experimentation) meetings, where the project has been received well. Ideas for a parallel WGNE 
	activity focused on tropospheric reanalyses have been discussed. S-RIP activities have the potential 
	to be important components of the Global Framework for Climate Services.</p>

	<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]<a name="prospects"></a><h3>Prospects for the Future</h3>
	S-RIP is planned to last for 5 years. However, given that a goal of S-RIP is to feed back scientific 
	results to the reanalysis centres (thus forming a “virtuous circle” of assessment => improved 
	reanalyses => more assessment => further improvement in reanalyses), and that most reanalysis 
	centres have in any event ongoing programmes to deliver new, improved reanalyses, it would be 
	valuable to continue S-RIP beyond its initial 5 years. It is thus critical to review the value of S-RIP with 
	the research community, reanalysis centres and the SPARC SSG after its first 5 years to determine 
        whether, and if so in what form, S-RIP should continue. It is hoped that some support from SPARC 
        will be maintained if it is decided that S-RIP should continue longer.</p>
 
        <p>It is important that the project has a lasting legacy to sustain the international interest in the 
        assessment of reanalyses. A prime legacy of the project is likely to be development of links between 
        researchers and reanalysis centres that mean future reanalysis developments will use the outcomes 
        from S-RIP assessments of reanalyses in a systematic, standardised way, rather than the more ad 
        hoc approaches that may pertain at present. A further legacy will be a data archive (at BADC) of 
        reanalyses datasets, at standard resolution to enable ease of intercomparison without further 
        processing, and which will be freely available to researchers world-wide and will continue to be a  
        useful means of assessing reanalyses beyond the lifetime of the project.</p>
